🛠️ TeamZone – React + Vite

Project Idea:
TeamZone is a football field booking platform built with React and Vite. The app allows users to browse available football fields, book a field, and view or cancel their bookings. Administrators can manage the fields and bookings.

How It Works:

Users visit the website, browse available football fields, and make bookings.

Bookings are stored temporarily in localStorage (or later in a backend).

Admins can view all bookings and manage the fields through the admin panel.

Tech Stack:

React – UI development

Vite – Fast development server

React Router – Page navigation

Context API – State management

Tailwind CSS – Styling

localStorage – Temporary storage for user state
